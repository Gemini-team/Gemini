# Gemini


Welcome to the official Gemini Simulator repository. Here all the code needed to build and run your own version of the Gemini Simulator is hosted. Gemini is based on a set of
platforms and tools to make the core simulation of an autonomous vessel work. The primary platforms that are used are Unity3D (https://unity.com/) and Open Simulation
platform (https://opensimulationplatform.com/).
